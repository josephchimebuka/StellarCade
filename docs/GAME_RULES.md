## 🎲 Randomness & Fairness

All game results are generated using our **Provably Fair RNG Contract**.

### How it Works:

1. **Server Seed**: Generated by the system.
2. **Client Seed**: Provided by your wallet/app.
3. **Nonce**: A sequential number for each game.
4. **Result**: The hash of (Server Seed + Client Seed + Nonce) determines the outcome.

The Server Seed is revealed after a game session ends, allowing you to verify the outcome yourself.

## 💰 House Edge & Prize Pools

Most games carry a small house edge (typically 2-3%). This edge is used for:

1. **Prize Pool Buffers**: Ensuring there's always enough to pay out winners.
2. **Platform Maintenance**: Future development and hosting.
3. **Community Rewards**: Occasional airdrops and bonuses.
